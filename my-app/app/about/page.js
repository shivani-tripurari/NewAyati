            <p className='text-[#1B3540] text-base text-justify pr-3'>Ayati Properties is established by an Architect and a Civil Engineer with an experience of 16 years with proficiency in the fields of Mining, Architecture, Infra, and Engineering. They aim to develop boutique projects in and around the city of Hyderabad while drawing from their decade and a half of learning in construction and its complimentary fields aiming to close the identified gaps and missed opportunities in the housing sector.

            At Ayati Properties staying rooted in traditional environments and understanding everyday living is at the core of its Sustainable design. The team is environmentally conscious with a clear goal in mind to assemble and execute well designed co-living spaces with the know-how as to how to achieve it.<br/>
            Aspirations for mindful co-living guide their purpose in creating an urban space for community living. Inspired by rural and social engineering, the projects undertaken by Ayati focus on sustainable community living that is rooted in traditional wisdom. To reach these aspirations at Ayati Properties, the personnel are consciously aware of the choices made during construction.<br/>
